This project is a page with few pictures from October bike trip to Cairngorms.
Focus on:
     - having a header image as wide a window,
     - text and images in boxes slightly narrower for clarity.
     - max width of window
     - use responsive images to fit screen size (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

To do:
     - select images and get them in several sizes (small, medium, big / full size)
     - create header with image, this should be responsive depending on window width => responsive images
     - create list (4 items) of images, this should be responsive depending on window width

Issues / To fix:
     - responsive images do not seem to work on Safari.
     - Title of page shows cairgorns


Website purpose:
    - Who for? Myself, family, friends
    - To do what? Keep my memories of trip to Cairgorms, tell about trip to others.
    - Contents? Just description of trip, photos taken with description. Possibly ref to ext content (tourist offices...)
